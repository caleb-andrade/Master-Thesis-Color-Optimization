# Master-Thesis-Color-Optimization
An optimization model for the design of a palette of colors, Mathematics Institute UNAM 2011-2014. This project is the subject of my MS thesis, in which I solved a discrete optimization problem with meta-heuristics, simulated annealing, and threshold accepting. The problem consists of the selection of an optimal set of welldifferentiated
colors. I wrote the code in Python to run the simulations and validated results with non-parametric tests.
